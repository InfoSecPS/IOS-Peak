# IOS-Peak
 
iOS Peak is a Windows Forms program that acts like a helper for iOS devices. You can do the following: 

- Create a working directory for downloads
- Connect via SSH and hold the connection open
- List the installed applications to a combo box
- Connect to Frida over the network, and use Objection without USB
- Pull the screenshots off the device into the Working Directory
- Respring the User Interface

  It's a small pet project that I regluarly use on iOS tests, so I thought i'd share it. It's still got features I want to add, but it's not a project i'll be updating all the time.
